    <h2>WNC's Farming Traditions</h2>

    <h2><em>Why Farmers Markets Matter</em></h2>

    <h3>Boosting Local Economies</h3>
    <p>
      Research conducted by the <strong>American Farmland Trust</strong> and local economic studies has found that dollars spent at
      farmers markets tend to recirculate within the community at a higher rate than those spent at chain retailers. Some reports
      indicate that every $1 spent at a farmers market can generate roughly <strong>twice the economic activity</strong> compared to
      traditional grocery dollars.

      (This source discusses the economic benefits of local food systems and includes multipliers related to farmers market spending.)
    </p>

    <h3>Local Retention Rates</h3>
    <p>
      Studies report that for every <strong>$100 spent at a local farmers market</strong>, approximately <strong>62% stays in the local economy</strong>,
      compared to only <strong>25% at chain retailers</strong>.

      (While the USDA ERS reports offer comprehensive data on market dynamics, check the latest reports for the most current figures.)
    </p>

    <h3>Supporting Small Farms & Businesses</h3>
    <p>
      Farmers markets allow small-scale farmers and artisans to sell directly to consumers, eliminating intermediaries and
      allowing them to capture a higher share of the final sale price. This <strong>direct-to-consumer model</strong> is well
      documented in various studies on local food systems.

      (See the section discussing the benefits for small producers.)
    </p>

    <h3>Vendor Demographics</h3>
    <p>
      Data from the <strong>National Farmers Market Directory</strong> and surveys of farmers market vendors have consistently
      shown that a significant majority—often <strong>over 85%</strong>—of vendors at farmers markets are small business
      owners who rely on these venues as a primary sales channel.
